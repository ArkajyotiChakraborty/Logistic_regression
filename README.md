# Titanic Survival Model.
Logistic Regression isn't a regression model it's a classification model. This is kind of different from the Linear Regression as in Linear regression we were making the best fit that gives the least mean square error so that we can make predictions on basis of that fit.


# What We do in Logistic Regression:
In logistic regression we train the model according to a categorical data. Now the outcome of the model basically shows that eighther it's Correct or Wrong.

According this image it's clear whatever categorical input we give it transforms the result into 0 or 1.
# About the project:
In this project we worked on the data set of the Titanic model where we configoured that the whether a person based on the certain paramenters will live or not.
# Result/Conclusion:
Got an accuracy of 77% on implementation.
